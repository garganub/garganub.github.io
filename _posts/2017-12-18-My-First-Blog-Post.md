title: To Blog, or Not to Blog? 
---

As a recovering speech and debate enthusiast, I've flirted with the idea of blogging for some time now. Until now, I was hesitant not because of a laziness to write or a lack of opinion, but instead because of fear. 

The blogs posts I've come to respect are often the ones that display the most honesty and effort. To write about my honest opinions and experiences feels dangerous for several reasons. If I articulate a bold opinion that the reader disagrees with, will they think less of me? If I read my past blog posts years from now, will I feel embarassed that these were the best thoughts I could present to the world? 

To be honest, I'm still concerned about these questions. But I think the learning benefits of blogging will far outweigh these concerns. In order to articulate my opinions and experiences effectively, I'll be forced to think more critically about what makes them valid/important. In many cases, I'll be forced to do additional research to feel comfortable in sharing these views. And in the end, tracking the growth of my writing/reasoning skills, as well as my knowledge base, will motivate my future self to continue growing. 

So, with a spark of excitement for my future posts, I must decide how to approach the blog. I could choose to blog about political events, like many of my fellow debate alums, but I find that many politcal blogs oversummarize or coddle their subject matter. I could also solely write about my personal experiences, but I think journalling is a better source of pure introspection.

Instead, I plan on using this blog as a sort of 'thought development' journal. I hope to write about subjects of interest, like technology and political ideology, with the intention that my perspectives will change over time. Through this process, I hope to prioritize my the development of my analysis over issues that I care about. 

I suppose all that's left is to get to writing. After all, ~execution is all that matters.
