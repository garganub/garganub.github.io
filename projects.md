### Web Projects
#### TestDriveLabs Website
This [site](http://www.testdrivelab.com/) was bulk of the work of my 2016 summer internship. In addition to writing the HTML and CSS from scratch (and for the first time significantly), I used Ruby on Rails to implement database implementation (through Postgres) and CRUD methods like dynamic page creation, database searching, removal, and login functionality. JavaScript was used for some simple link and style integration. 

#### CoOperatus Platform
This [site](http://www.cooperatus.com/) is the foundation of long term vision that I and a team of Novus Think Tank members have to improve collaborative practices for college organizations. Many college orgs, inundated by slow communication, poor file management, and litle awareness of extra-organizational activites on campus, have been slow to collaborate with others. Although the site is currently a directory database (built with Laravel, PHP, and MySQL) that uses Google . Our goal is to build a platform with several other features to address organizations' needs, including a custom calendar, file management portal, and user-specific management abilities.

#### Novus Think Tank Website
As Novus Think Tank's Co-President, I redesigned our static [webiste](http://www.uscnovus.org/) using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### Mobile Projects
#### VirtualChips
This [app](https://github.com/garganub/virtual-chips) was a group project for Fall 2017 CS class. Our group built an iOS application (run by going into ios > VirtualChips) that uses a Java server and MySQL database to allow a group of poker players to bet using our application--removing the need for physical chips. Our goal was to allow people to play poker person to person for social benefits, but remove the complexity, expense, and inconvenience of using poker chips.
